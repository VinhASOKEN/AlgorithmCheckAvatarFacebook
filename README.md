# Algorithm Check Avatar Facebook

This project aims to classify Facebook avatar images into two categories: 
1. **None** - the default white silhouette image displayed when a user hasn't updated their Facebook profile picture.
2. **Normal** - any user-uploaded profile picture.

## Solutions

The project includes three different solutions for classification:

### Solution 1: Histogram-Based Algorithm
``` bash
# The algorithm runs efficiently, fast while maintaining a solid accuracy rate.
# Inference
python solution_1.py
```

### Solution 2: HOG Feature Extraction
``` bash
# This solution employs Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction.
# Inference
python solution_2.py
```

### Solution 3: SIFT Feature Extraction
``` bash
# In this approach, I utilize the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm.
# Inference
python solution_3.py
```
