# Algorithm Check Avatar Facebook

This project aims to classify Facebook avatar images into two categories: 
1. **None** - the default white silhouette image displayed when a user hasn't updated their Facebook profile picture.
2. **Normal** - any user-uploaded profile picture.

## Solutions

The project includes three different solutions for classification:

### Solution 1: Histogram-Based Algorithm
``` bash
The algorithm runs efficiently, providing fast performance without the need for heavy AI models, while maintaining a solid accuracy rate.
```

### Solution 2: HOG Feature Extraction
``` bash
This solution employs Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction for image classification.
```

### Solution 3: SIFT Feature Extraction
``` bash
In this approach, I utilize the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm.
```

## Performance
The algorithms are designed to run quickly, ensuring a seamless user experience. Users can run the provided script `solution_1.py` to test the accuracy and frames per second (FPS) performance of the histogram-based algorithm.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and run the solution scripts.
